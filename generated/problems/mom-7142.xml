Pollsters are concerned about declining levels of cooperation among persons contacted in surveys.  A pollster contacts 96 people in the 18-21 age bracket and finds that 82 of them respond and 14 refuse to respond.  When 248 people in the 22-29 age bracket are contacted, 215 respond and 33 refuse to respond.  Assume that 1 of the 344 people is randomly selected.  Find the probability of getting someone in the 22-29 age bracket <em>OR</em> someone who refused to respond.</p>
<p>
Report the answer as a percent rounded to one decimal place accuracy.
You need not enter the "<percent/>" symbol. </p>
