Pollsters are concerned about declining levels of cooperation among persons contacted in surveys.  A pollster contacts 83 people in the 18-21 age bracket and finds that 70 of them respond and 13 refuse to respond.  When 301 people in the 22-29 age bracket are contacted, 271 respond and 30 refuse to respond.  Assume that 1 of the 384 people is randomly selected.  Find the probability of getting someone in the 22-29 age bracket <em>OR</em> someone who agreed to respond.</p>
<p>
Report the answer as a percent rounded to one decimal place accuracy.
