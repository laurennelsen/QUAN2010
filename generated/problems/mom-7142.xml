Pollsters are concerned about declining levels of cooperation among persons contacted in surveys.  A pollster contacts 99 people in the 18-21 age bracket and finds that 84 of them respond and 15 refuse to respond.  When 253 people in the 22-29 age bracket are contacted, 218 respond and 35 refuse to respond.  Assume that 1 of the 352 people is randomly selected.  Find the probability of getting someone in the 22-29 age bracket <em>OR</em> someone who agreed to respond.</p>
