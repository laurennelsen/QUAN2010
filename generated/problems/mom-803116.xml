<statement>
<p>Scherita is conducting market research on the cost of  homeowners insurance. Scherita has determined that the average annual cost of  homeowners insurance is <dollar/>1262, and that the distribution of costs is normally distributed with a standard deviation of <dollar/>50. </p>
<p>a. Find the probability that a single randomly selected consumer spends less than <dollar/>1194 on  homeowners insurance.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><fillin characters="20" /></p>
<p>b. The cost of the middle 80<percent/> of  homeowners insurance policies falls between (round to the nearest dollar):</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><dollar/><fillin characters="20" /> to <dollar/><fillin characters="20" /> per year.</p>
<p>c. The <em>most expensive </em>11<percent/> of  homeowners insurance policies cost at least how much annually?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><dollar/><fillin characters="20" /></p>

</statement>
<solution>
<p><ul><li>0.0869</li><li>1198</li><li>1326</li><li>1323</li></ul></p><p>Define the normal distribution in Desmos: <m>\displaystyle{N}=\text{normaldist}{\left({1262},{50}\right)}</m>.</p>
<p>a. <m>\displaystyle{P}{\left({x}{<}{1194}\right)}={N}.{c}{d}{f{{\left({1194}\right)}}}={0.0869}</m><less/>/p<greater/></p>
<p>b. For the middle 80<percent/> of the data, need the remaining 20<percent/> of the data split between the left and right tails of the distribution. So the lower bound of the range has <m>\displaystyle{0.1}</m> of the area to the left and the upper bound of the range has <m>\displaystyle{0.1}</m> of the area to the right, which means <m>\displaystyle{0.9}</m> to the left. Therefore:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Lower bound <m>\displaystyle={N}.\text{inversecdf}{\left({0.1}\right)}={1198}</m></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Upper bound <m>\displaystyle={N}.\text{inversecdf}{\left({0.9}\right)}={1326}</m></p>
<p>c. For the most expensive 11<percent/> of the distribution, need <m>\displaystyle{0.11}</m> of the area to the right of the data value, so need <m>\displaystyle{1}-{0.0}{.11}={0.89}</m> to the left. Therefore:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"> <m>\displaystyle{x}={N}.\text{inversecdf}{\left({0.89}\right)}={1323}</m> </p>
