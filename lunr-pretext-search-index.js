In our study of inferential statistics, we might want to ask a question such as the following:   What is the average number of hours per week worked by students at UCCCS?   How would you answer this question?     Definitions and Terms        population : set containing all the people or objects whose properties are to be described and analyzed by the data collector     sample : a subset or subgroup of the population              parameter : number that describes a characteristic of a population     statistic : a number that describes a characteristic of a sample        A group of hotel owners in a large city decide to conduct a survey among citizens of the city to discover their opinions about casino gambling.   Describe the population   The population is the set containing all citizens of the city.   One of the hotel owners suggests obtaining a sample by surveying all the people at size of the largest nightclubs in the city on a Saturday night. The people surveyed will be asked to express their opinion on casino gambling. Does this seem like a good idea?   No, it does not! The people at the nightclub might not have the same attitude toward casino gambling as the population of all the city's citizens.       A random sample is a sample obtained in such a way that every element in the population has an equal chance of being selected for the sample.     Think again about the group of hotel owners from who are in a large city and are interested in how the city's citizen's feel about casino gambling. Which of the following would be the most appropriate way to select a random sample?     Randomly survey people who live in the oceanfront condominiums in the city.      Survey the first 200 people whose names appear in the city's telephone directory.      Randomly select neighborhoods of the city and then randomly survey people within the selected neighborhoods.       Regardless of the sampling technique used, the sample should exhibit characteristics typical of those possessed by the target population.  This type of sample is called a representative sample .

  "title": "Types of Data",
  "body": " Types of Data   The purpose of descriptive statistics is to summarize or display data so that the audience can quickly obtain an overview of the information. There are two main types of data: quantitative data and qualitative data .  Let's define those and other types of data we will work with in this course. Then we will move on to review how Excel is used to create meaningful tables, charts, and graphs that summarize our data.         Quantitative data uses numbers to describe data.     Qualitative data uses descriptive terms, i.e. categories, to describe data.              Discrete values are based on observations that can be counted and are typically represented by whole numbers.     Continuous values are based on measured observations and can take on any real number.        Which of the following are discrete values?     number of iPads sold      number of light bulbs that burned for more than 1000 hours in a quality control program      weight      time      distance      number of hours a light bulb burned before going out      Which of the following are continuous values?     number of iPads sold      number of light bulbs that burned for more than 1000 hours in a quality control program      weight      time      distance      number of hours a light bulb burned before going out       Levels of Measurement       A nominal level of measurement deals strictly with qualitative data assigned to predetermined categories.  Examples: marital status, gender, political affiliation    An ordinal level of measurement has all the properties of nominal data but with the added feature that we can rank order values from highest to lowest.  Examples: college class level, course letter grade    An interval level of measurement deals strictly with quantitative data allowing the measurement of difference between categories with actual numbers in a meaningful way.  Examples: temperature (in degrees Celsius or Fahrenheit), SAT score, birth year of baseball players    A ratio level of measurement has all the features of interval data but with the added benefit of having a true zero point.  Examples: age, height, weight, number of home runs          Identify the type of data (qualitative, quantitative-discrete, quantitative-continuous) and the level of measurement for each data source.   the temperature outside (in degrees Fahrenheit)   quantitative-continuous, interval   the price for one gallon of gasoline   quantitative-continuous, ratio   the letter grade earned in your statistics class   qualitative, ordinal   the number of boxes of Cheerios on the shelf of a grocery store   quantitative-discrete, ratio   the types of cars driven by students in your class   qualitative, nominal   the number of times a person goes to the gym in a week   quantitative-discrete, ratio   "
