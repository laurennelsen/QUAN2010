Two Types of Random Variables:  discrete random variable: outcomes are whole numbers after performing an experiment  continuous random variable: outcomes are any numerical value (including decimals or fractions) after performing an experiment      ...insert examples of these types of random variables..... ....Random variables can be distributed differently....    A discrete probability distribution is a listing of all possible outcomes of an experiment for a discrete random variable along with the relative frequency of each outcome   Each outcome in the distribution must be mutually exclusive     for all ; i.e., the probability of each outcome is between 0 and 1     ; the sum of all probabilities is 1       "

The mean, or expected value of a discrete probability distribution is the weighted average of all outcomes of the random variable.     The expected monetary value is the mean when the discrete random variable is in dollars ($)    The variance of a discrete probability distribution measures the spread of the individual values around the mean.     The standard deviation of a discrete probability distribution measures the dispersion of the outcome of the random variable in relation to the mean.
