The mean ( or ) is the most common measure of central tendency and is calculated by summing all the data points and dividing by the size of the data set.     The mean is the sum of the data items divided by the number of items: where represents the sum of all the data items and represents the numbef of items.     The mean of a sample is symbolized by .    The mean of an entire population is symbolized by .        The Excel file below has the earnings for the top 10 highest paid actors in 2023. (The data is taken from Yahoo .)     Find the mean earnings, in millions of dollars, for the ten highest-earning actors.    million dollars     The median is the value in the data set for which half of the observations are higher and half are lower.       To find the median of a group of data items,   Arrange the data items in order, from smallest to largest.    If the number of data items is odd, the median is the data item in the middle of the list.    If the number of data items is even, the median is the mean of the two middle data items.      Find the median for each of the following groups of data:       data items in order:   median:    data items in order:       median:     The Excel file below has the earnings for the top 10 highest paid actors in 2023.

The coefficient of variation (cv) measures the standard deviation in terms of its percentage of the mean.         The -score identifies the number of standard deviations a particular value is from the mean of its distribution.           The mean weight of newborn infants is 7 pounds, and the standard deviation is 0.8 pound. The weights of newborn infants are normally distributed .

Intelligence quotients (IQs) on the Stanford-Binet intelligence test are normally distributed with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 16. What is the IQ corresponding to a -score of ?       The Empirical Rule  The Empirical Rule says that if a distribution follows a bell-shaped, symmetric curve centered around the mean, then we should expect:   approximately of the data to fall within one standard deviation of the mean,    approximately of the data to fall within two standard deviations of the mean, and    approximately of the data to fall within three standard deviations of the mean.

  "title": "Introduction to Probability",
  "body": " Introduction to Probability   Decision makers, including those in the business world, are greatly influenced by uncertainty. Probability provides a valuable tool in quantifying uncertainty, leading to greater success in decision-making.     A probability is a numerical value between 0 and 1 that measures the chance, or likelihood, that a specific event will occur.    Before jumping into some examples, let's discuss some key terms for our study of probability concepts.       An experiment results in a specific outcome e.g., a coin flip (the experiment) results in a heads or a tails (the outcome).    An event is a collection of outcome(s) of an experiment, e.g., a die roll results in an odd number . More specifically, a simple event is an event with a single outcome.    The sample space for an experiment consists of all possible outcomes e.g., .    The outcomes must be collectively exhaustive and mutually exclusive .     Collectively exhaustive means every simple event is included     Mutually exclusive means events that cannot occur at the same time.            A single die is rolled.   Define the sample space.       Define the event an odd number is rolled . What is the probability of this event?        A pair of dice are rolled.   Define the sample space. (How many total possible outcomes are there?)    There are 36 total possible outcomes.   Define the event doubles are rolled . What is the probability of this event?        Define the event the sum of the dice is 10 . What is the probability of this event?         (Donnelly 4.8)  The table below shows the frequencies of executives' salary ranges at a particular organization.    Salary Range  Frequency    Under $60,000  2    $60,000 to under $70,000  5    $70,000 to under $80,000  7    $80,000 to under $90,000  4    $90,000 to under $100,000  6    $100,000 or more  ?    Total:  26       How many executives at this organization earned $100,000 or more per year?       What is the probability of randomly selecting an executive who earned $100,000 or more per year?       What is the probability of randomly selecting an executive who earned $60,000 or more per year?       What is the probability of randomly selecting an executive who earned between $70,000 and $90,000 per year?            Basic Properties of Probability:   If , then event is certain to occur.    If , then event is certain to NOT occur.    The probability of any event must range between 0 and 1 (inclusive).    The sum of all probabilities of simple events in a sample space is equal to 1.        The complement , (or ), is defined as all outcomes in the sample space that are not in .      The complement rule:      Draw one card from a standard deck of 52 playing cards. (Here is a link to a description of a deck of cards: )   How many total outcomes are in the sample space for this experiment?       What is the probability of drawing a face card ?       What is the probability of drawing a card divisible by 3 ?       What is the probability of drawing a card NOT divisible by 3 ?       What is the probability of drawing a card that is a face card and a card divisible by 3 ?   0   What is the probability of drawing a card that is a red card or a black card ?   1        A contingency table shows the number of occurrences of events that are classified by two categorical variables.     Marginal probability is a simple probability found in the margins, or row and column totals, of a contingency table.        (Donnelly 4.19)  A local car dealership currently has 36 used GM, Ford, and Toyota vehicles on the lot that can be classified as either cars or trucks. The following data are available:   Twenty-six vehicles are cars    Eleven vehicles are GMs    Fifteen vehicles are Fords    Three vehicles are both Toyotas and trucks    Fourteen vehicles are both Toyotas and trucks      ....(Figure out how to make fillable table......) Create a contingency table that summarizes the data.   What is the probability that a randomly selected vehicle is a Toyota?       What is the probability that a randomly selected vehicle is a truck?         The intersection of Events A and B represents the number of times when events A and B occur at the same time   Notation:     The union of Events A and B represents the number of times when event A or event B or both occur.   Notation:         Union and Intersection (Made in GeoGebra by Vaibhav Zade)       The joint probability of two events is the probability of the intersection of two events.     The addition rule for probabilities is used to calculate the probability of the union of events. It depends on knowing whether or not two events are mutually exclusive.     For mutually exclusive events,     For events that are not mutually exclusive,        Use the contingency table from the previous exercise... (insert!!!!!) to answer the following questions.   What is the probability that a randomly selected vehicle is either a Ford or a car?       What is the probability that a randomly selected vehicle is a GM truck?              Conditional probability is the probability that event A will occur given that event B has occurred.  This probability is denoted by , and is the probability of A given B .     (Made in GeoGebra by Virginia Keith)     Which of the following is the formula used to calculate ?                                      Prior probability: the probability that an event will occur as determined without any additional information that could affect it     Posterior probability: a revision of a prior probability using additional information        Let's look back at the contingency table from previous exercises.....

A sampling distribution of the mean is a distribution of the mean from numerous samples of the sample size. This distribution has mean and a standard error (i.e. the standard deviation of the sample means) .    There are three important properties that describe the distribution of sample means:   The sampling distribution of the mean of a random variable drawn from any population is approximately normal for sufficiently large sample size. The larger the sample size, the more closely the sample distribution resembles a normal distribution.    The mean of the sample means will be the same as the population mean; that is, .    The standard deviation of the sample means will be smaller than the standard deviation of the population; specifically,       (Donnelly 7.7)  For a population with a mean equal to 250 and a standard deviation equal to 25, calculate the standard error of the mean for the following sample sizes.   20       50       80        What can you conclude about the standard error as the sample size increases?

  "title": "The Central Limit Theorem",
  "body": " The Central Limit Theorem    In short, the Central Limit Theorem says:  For any population distribution with a sufficiently large sample, the sample means are normally distributed.    There are basically three scenarios that come up that involve the use of the Central Limit Theorem:   If the samples are drawn from a normal population, then the sampling distribution of the sample means will also be normally distributed regardless of the size of the samples.    The sampling distribution of the sample means will not be normally distributed when samples of size are drawn from a population that is not necessarily normal.    If samples of size are drawn from a population that is not necessarily normal, then the Central Limit Theorem does not apply and we cannot draw conclusions about the sampling distribution of the sample means.      Bottom line: If the sample size is large enough, then we can use the Central Limit Theorem to answer the questions about sample means using the same techniques that we used to answer questions about individual values of a normally distributed population. All we need to do is adjust the -score calculation to account for the new standard deviation.    (Donnelly 7.8)  For a normal population with a mean equal to 87 and a standard deviation equal to 26, determine the probability of observing a sample mean of 90 or less from a sample of size 15.        (Donnelly 7.9)  For a population that is left-skewed with a mean of 21 and a standard deviation equal to 15, determine the probability of observing a sample mean of 18 or more from a sample of size 33.        (Donnelly 7.21)  According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), adults worked an average of 1771 hours in 2016. Assume the population standard deviation is 390 hours and that a random sample of 50 adults was selected.   Calculate the standard error of the mean.       What is the probability that the sample mean will be more than 1790 hours?       What is the probability that the sample mean will be between 1720 and 1760 hours?       Would a sample mean of 1799 hours support the claim made by the organization?    There is a chance of observing a sample mean as high as 1799, so 1799 is not unusual. Therefore, the claim is reasonable.   Identify the symmetrical interval that includes of the sample means if the true population mean is 1771 hours.       "

  "body": " The Sampling Distribution of the Proportion  So far, the focus in this chapter has been on the distribution of sample means. However, sometimes we deal with business scenarios where we are counting observations in a sample and in this case the sample proportion (or percentage), , is the statistic that is relevant rather than the sample mean, .  .....insert activity to make sense of this.....    The sampling distribution of the proportion describes the pattern that the sample proportions tend to follow when randomly drawn from a population. This distribution has a mean, , and a standard error (i.e. the standard deviation of the sample proportions), .     (Donnelly 7.25)  For a population with a proportion equal to 0.32, calculate the standard error of the proportion for the following sample sizes.                            What can you conclude about the standard error as the sample size increases?     As the sample size increases, standard error decreases      As the sample size increases, standard error increases.      As the sample size increases, standard error stays the same.      As the sample size increases, the standard error might increase, decrease, or stay the same.      (Donnelly 7.32)  A social media survey found that of parents follow their children on Instagram.

What is the probability that between 97 and 104 parents from this sample follow their children on Instagram?       If 81 parents responded that the follow their children on Instagram, does this result support the findings of the social media survey?    Since (less than ), the sample with only 81 parents answering yes is unusual. Therefore, the survey results are questionable.   "

  "title": "The Normal Distribution",
  "body": " The Normal Distribution   The mathematical expression that describes the shape of the normal probability distribution is called the normal probability density function: Despite the complexity of this function, there are only two parameters that completely deter- mine the shape of the distribution: the mean, , and the standard deviation, . Let’s take a closer look at how they impact the distribution. (Don’t worry---we won’t be using this formula to compute probabilities. We have other tools!)     How does changing the standard deviation ( ) and the mean ( ) change the curve?  Graph of Normal Distribution powered by Desmos           controls the spread of the curve. Larger results in a flatter, more spread out curve     controls the location of the center. Larger shifts the hill of the curve to the right        Characteristics of the Normal Probability Distribution:     The distribution is bell-shaped and symmetric around the mean.    Because the shape is symmetrical, the mean and median are equal and located at the center of the distribution.    Random variables around the mean, where the curve is the tallest have a higher probability of occurring than values toward the end of the distribution.    The total area under the curve is . Since the distribution is symmetric, the area to the left of the mean equals as does the area to the right of the mean    No matter how far in either direction the distribution curve extends, it never touches the horizontal axis -- but it gets increasingly closer.       Examples of Normal Probability Distributions:      The Standard Normal Distribution:  Recall that the -score of a value, , describes the number of standard deviations that the value is from the mean of its distribution:    Values of that are less than the mean have _______ -scores     postive      negative      zero      Values of that are more than the mean have _______ -scores     positive      negative      zero      The -score for the mean equals ________                                A coffee shop wants to understand the distribution of amounts that their customers are spending per order. They find that the average amount a customer spends per order is , and the standard deviation is . If we assume that the amounts spent per order are normally distributed, and Rey comes in and spends , what is the -score for Rey's order?        When the original random variable, , follows a normal distribution, -scores also follow a normal distribution with , . It is called the standard normal distribution .     Graph of Standard Normal Distribution powered by Desmos      Calculating Probabilities for Normal Distributions:  The standard normal distribution allows us to calculate probabilities for any normal distribution since we can standardize it with -scores. The tables at this link ( Standard Normal Table ) provide you with the cumulative area to the LEFT of the -score.  We can also use Excel to calculate the cumulative area to the left of the -score by typing   ( Note: We can type 1 instead of TRUE in this formula in Excel.)     Find the probability for a standard normal distribution    In Excel:      So how do we use the table or the Excel formula to find any probability for a normal distribution?  There are 3 basic types of problems:   To the left of any -score: Look up the -score in the table (or calculate it in Excel) and use the area given.    To the right of any -score: Look up the -score in the table (or calculate it in Excel) subtract the area from 1.    Between any two -scores: Look up both -scores in the table (or calculate them in Excel) and subtract the smaller area from the larger area.       Find the following probabilities for a standard normal distribution:       In Excel:         In Excel:         In Excel:       Normal Distribution Probability Calculator (Made in GeoGebra by Andreas Lindner)     We already saw an Excel command that will allow us to find a probability associated with a standard normal distribution. There is also an Excel command that allows us to find a probability associated with a general normal distribution, and in this case, we will need to specify the mean and standard deviation of the distribution. (These first two commands both apply to situations where the goal is to compute a probability associated with a data value.)    : applies to problems involving a normal distribution with a specified mean and standard deviation     : applies to problems involving the standard normal distribution ( )   (As we've seen before, cumulative .)

We DO NOT say there is a chance that the population mean falls between A and B . It might sound the same, but it is not. The latter implies that the population mean is a variable that we can say something about. But it is not -- it is fixed, and we do not know what it is.  Remember that we develop our confidence interval based on the sampling distribution of the sample mean. We draw a sample and calculate an interval around the sample mean and say that we think we have captured the population mean within the interval -- we do NOT know anything about the population mean. We can only say something about our sample mean and interval.  If we were to repeatedly draw samples, each has the same margin of error (since the sample size and are constant for all samples), but each sample mean likely varies. After calculating all intervals, of them would result in intervals that include the population mean, but of them would have sample means so extreme (in the tail of the sampling distribution) that they would not include the population mean.

  "body": " Confidence Intervals for the Mean ( unknown)  Up to this point we have assumed that the population standard deviation, , was known. This is unrealistic -- since we are creating an interval to estimate the population mean, , we likely don't know the population standard deviation either! Hence we will estimate with the value of the sample standard deviation, . But this introduces another source of unreliability, especially in small samples. To keep the confidence interval at the desired level, we make the intervals wider by replacing the critical values in our confidence interval formula, , with larger critical values, .   The Student's -Distribution  The larger critical values come from the Student's -distribution developed in 1908 by an Irish brewing employee, William S. Gosset. He was a Guinness Brewery employee researching new methods of manufacturing ale. He needed a distribution that could be used with small samples. Employees were not allowed to publish research results, so he published under the pseudonym, Student .  The key properties of the Student's -Distribution:   It is symmetric around the mean (which is 0 just like the standard normal distribution) and mound-shaped (similar to bell-shaped).    It is a family of curves based on the concept of degrees of freedom (df) , which refer to the number of values that are free to vary. As the degrees of freedom increases, the shape of the -distribution becomes similar to the normal distribution.  When dealing with the sample mean, .    The area under the curve is equal to .    The -distribution is flatter and wider than the normal distribution. This means that the critical score for the -distribution is therefore higher than the critical -score for the same confidence level. This results in wider confidence intervals when using the -distribution.       Confidence Interval When is Unknown  The formula for the confidence interval when is unknown is: where   How do we find the critical values, ?    Table: Use this link ...insert.... (or Table 5 in Appendix A of the textbook). Note that you will locate the degrees of freedom along the left column and the confidence level across the top of the table -- the desired critical value is located where the two meet inside the table.

However, we don't want the margin of error to be too big, and we want to know how many students to survey to get the margin of error that we want.  How large a sample is necessary to make an accurate estimate? The answer is not simple, since it depends on three things:   The confidence level    The standard deviation    The margin of error     The more confident we want to be, the wider we want our interval, but there is a tradeoff. If an interval is too wide, it provides little information. On the other hand, a narrow interval requires a larger sample size and sampling can be a costly procedure. Hence it is handy to be able to be able to calculate ahead of time the sample size required to achieve a specified margin of error. With a bit of algebra on the appropriate margin of error from the confidence interval formula, we can determine the sample size.      The formula when working with a mean is:     The formula when working with a proportion is:     If necessary, round the answer UP to obtain a whole number.

  "title": "Introduction to Hypothesis Testing",
  "body": " Introduction to Hypothesis Testing   Hypothesis testing is one of the most widely used procedures in statistics today, so we will spend more than one chapter discussing it. What is a hypothesis test?  The basic idea behind hypothesis testing is to assume that a population parameter equals some value (the null hypothesis), draw a sample and calculate a statistic, then use sampling distributions concepts to determine the likelihood of drawing such a sample, given the assumption of the parameter value.  Suppose we draw a random sample from the population and get a sample mean higher than the population mean. How far it is from the population mean? If > is true, what is the probability that we would get this value? Is it so different from our hypothesized mean that our hypothesis cannot be true? We have to decide what so different means. Our sampling distribution tells us that the mean of all possible sample means should be the same as >, so we can use those probability concepts to decide whether we think this sample statistic is extreme enough from the hypothesized mean to reject the null hypothesis.  The purpose of hypothesis statements is to draw a conclusion about population parameters, for which we do not have complete information.    We want to say something about the average number of hours students at UCCS work per work.

  "body": " The Nuts and Bolts of Hypothesis Testing   We will learn two different procedures for completing a hypothesis test, but before we describe each, let's do an example of how one of these procedures would work.    Let's say a group on campus is claiming that the average number of hours worked per week by students on campus is .  We want to see if this claim is reasonable, so we are going to go out and survey students and find the average number of hours worked per week for students in our sample.   We survey students, and the sample average is hours per week. If the population mean really is , what is the probability of getting a sample mean this extreme?   We survey students, and the sample average is hours per week. If the population mean really is , what is the probability of getting a sample mean this extreme?        The rejection region is the range of values for a test statistic that cause us to reject .    A critical value is the boundary that separates the rejection region from the rest.    A p-value is the probability of observing a sample statistic at least as extreme as the one selected, assuming is true.       !!!!!!INSERT Exercises 4 and 5 from the notes!!!!!!   The Logic of Hypothesis Testing  The hypothesis test begins with the assumption that the null hypothesis, , is true. The goal of the process is to determine if there is enough evidence provided by the sample to infer that the alternative hypothesis, , might be true instead.  The null hypothesis can never be accepted. The most we can say is that we do not have enough evidence to reject the null. The only two options are to:   reject the null hypothesis;    fail to reject the null hypothesis.     So how is the decision made to reject or fail to reject within each of our two hypothesis testing methods?      Traditional (Critical Value) Method:   In the traditional method, the decision is made by comparing the test statistic to the critical value(s). When the test statistic falls in the rejection region, the decision is reject the null hypothesis . When the test statistic does not fall in the rejection region, the decision is fail to reject the null hypothesis .     p-value Method:   In the p-value method, the decision is made by comparing the p-value to the significance level. When the p-value is smaller than the significance level, the decision is reject the null hypothesis . When the p-value is greater than or equal to the significance level, the decision is fail to reject the null hypothesis .     Now we    Two approaches to Hypothesis Testing  Now we are finally ready to describe in depth two hypothesis testing procedures and work through some examples. First, let's summarize the steps for the traditional method (aka the critical value method).     The Traditional (Critical Value) Method of Hypothesis Testing:      Identify the two hypotheses using appropriate notation.    Draw the appropriate curve, identify the significance level, and label critical value(s).    Calculate the appropriate test statistic.    Compare the critical value(s) to the test statistic and make the decision.    State the conclusion.       Let's work through an example using the traditional method. In this example, the appropriate test statistic formula is:    (Donnelly 9.7)  A pizza place recently hired additional drivers and as a result now claims that its average delivery time for orders is under 46 minutes. A sample of 41 customer deliveries was examined, and the average delivery time was found to be 41.5 minutes. Historically, the standard deviation for delivery time is 11.8 minutes. Assuming that , does this sample provide enough evidence to support the delivery time claim made by the pizza place?   Step 1: Identify the two hypotheses using appropriate notation.       :      : ( left-tail test)      Step 2: Draw the appropriate curve, identify the significance level, and label critical value(s).   Step 3: Calculate the appropriate test statistic.       Step 4: Compare the critical value(s) to the test statistic and make the decision.   Test statistic is left of the critical value so it lands in the rejection region, and we reject  .   Step 5: State the conclusion.   There is enough evidence to support the claim that the average delivery time for orders is under 46 minutes.    (Donnelly 9.10)  A grocery store claims that customers spend an average of 5 minutes waiting for service at the store's deli counter. A random sample of 40 customers was timed at the deli counter, and the average service time was found to be 5.5 minutes. Assume the standard deviation is 1.7 minutes per customer. Assuming that , does this sample provide enough evidence to counter the claim made by the store's management?   Step 1: Identify the two hypotheses using appropriate notation.       :      : ( two-tail test)      Step 2: Draw the appropriate curve, identify the significance level, and label critical value(s).   Step 3: Calculate the appropriate test statistic.       Step 4: Compare the critical value(s) to the test statistic and make the decision.   The test statistic is between the two critical values so it doesn't land in the rejection region, and we fail to reject  .   Step 5: State the conclusion.   The sample does not provide enough evidence to counter the claim that customers spend an average of 5 minutes waiting for service.      The p- Method of Hypothesis Testing:      Identify the two hypotheses using appropriate notation.    Draw the appropriate curve, identify the significance level.    Calculate the appropriate test statistic and the associated p-value.    Compare the p-value and the significance level and make the decision.    State the conclusion.        (Donnelly 9.8)  A sporting goods store believes the average age of its customers is 38 or less. A random sample of 40 customers was surveyed, and the average customer age was found to be 41.2 years.

  "body": " Using Regression to Make a Prediction  We can use our regression model to make predictions based on given values of the independent variables -- just plug the given values into the respective independent variable of the regression model. But how reliable is this prediction? We only have sample data so the prediction isn't perfect. Similar to what we did in a previous chapter, we will construct a confidence interval to aid in describing the accuracy of our predictions.  There are a number of confidence intervals that we can create based on our regression model that provide insight into the validity of the model. The only one we will focus on is related to the population slopes: It turns out we will likely not need this formula, however, since the Regression tool in Excel will do most of the work for us.   Let's look back at the hospital example from earlier.  A hospital would like to develop a regression model to predict the total hospital bill for a patient based on the age of the patient ( ), the patient's length of stay ( ), and the number of days in the hospital's intensive care unit (ICU) ( ).

  "title": "Diamonds Modeling",
  "body": " Diamonds Modeling  (Background on diamonds was provided in part by research done at https:\/\/www.brilliance.com\/education\/diamonds\/depth-table)  When a gemologist determines the value of a diamond, he or she considers a number of different factors. These factors are known as the 4C's (carat, color, clarity, and cut). How large is the diamond? The size (really the weight) of the diamond is measured in carats. Is it colorless or does it have a slight hue of color? Are there any visible inclusions in the diamond (this affects the clarity)?  Was the stone cut well? This is described by both the table and the depth. They both helps to define the physical shape of a diamond and contribute to its sparkle. When these two features are proportioned just right, a diamond of any size looks spectacular.  Every diamond has a flat, square-shaped facet on its top called the table. It plays a critical role in a diamond’s appearance. The table refracts rays of light as they pass, directing them to the facets that make the diamond look so sparkly. The physical size of the table facet naturally varies depending on the overall size of the diamond. Jewelers measure the table percentage when grading a diamond’s cut. Table percentage is calculated by dividing the width of the table by the overall width of the diamond. The ideal table percentage will vary based on the shape of the diamond.  The depth of a diamond might also be called the “height”: it is the distance from the table to the culet (the pointed tip) of the diamond. Like with a diamond’s table, jewelers grade a diamond’s depth based on its depth percentage. Depth percentage is the diamond’s depth divided by the width of the diamond. This percentage dictates the overall proportions of the diamond, which in turn directly impact how light reflects off the facets in the stone.   Here is the file we are going to use for this problem:   The price of diamonds is not just determined by size, but by multiple characteristics. For simplicity, in this example we will start with size. Create the scatterplot for the two variables Price and Carat .     Determine the least squares line. Interpret the slope coefficient.    According to your least squares line, what would you expect the price to be for a 5 carat diamond?    Compute the coefficient of correlation. What does it tell you about the relationship between the size of a diamond and the price?       We're going to use the same file we used in the previous problem:   Now we will take into consideration the other characteristics of diamonds that determine price: carat, color, clarity, and cut. Let's redo the regression and create a model that does a better job than the one in the previous example that only included a single predictor variable.     Create the regression model with all 5 variables that are provided: color, depth (in percentage), clarity, table (in percentage), and carat.    Interpret each of the coefficients in the model.    Do all 5 of the predictor variables belong in the model? Why or why not?    Is the overall model valid? Why or why not?    What is the coefficient of determination? What does it tell you about the model?    Remove variables one by one and reassess the model. What is the best model to predict the price of a diamond? Why?      "
