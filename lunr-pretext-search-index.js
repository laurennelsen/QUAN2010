  "title": "Diamonds Modeling",
  "body": " Diamonds Modeling  (Background on diamonds was provided in part by research done at https:\/\/www.brilliance.com\/education\/diamonds\/depth-table)  When a gemologist determines the value of a diamond, he or she considers a number of different factors. These factors are known as the 4C's (carat, color, clarity, and cut). How large is the diamond? The size (really the weight) of the diamond is measured in carats. Is it colorless or does it have a slight hue of color? Are there any visible inclusions in the diamond (this affects the clarity)?  Was the stone cut well? This is described by both the table and the depth. They both helps to define the physical shape of a diamond and contribute to its sparkle. When these two features are proportioned just right, a diamond of any size looks spectacular.  Every diamond has a flat, square-shaped facet on its top called the table. It plays a critical role in a diamond’s appearance. The table refracts rays of light as they pass, directing them to the facets that make the diamond look so sparkly. The physical size of the table facet naturally varies depending on the overall size of the diamond. Jewelers measure the table percentage when grading a diamond’s cut. Table percentage is calculated by dividing the width of the table by the overall width of the diamond. The ideal table percentage will vary based on the shape of the diamond.  The depth of a diamond might also be called the “height”: it is the distance from the table to the culet (the pointed tip) of the diamond. Like with a diamond’s table, jewelers grade a diamond’s depth based on its depth percentage. Depth percentage is the diamond’s depth divided by the width of the diamond. This percentage dictates the overall proportions of the diamond, which in turn directly impact how light reflects off the facets in the stone.   Here is the file we are going to use for this problem:   The price of diamonds is not just determined by size, but by multiple characteristics. For simplicity, in this example we will start with size. Create the scatterplot for the two variables Price and Carat .     Determine the least squares line. Interpret the slope coefficient.    According to your least squares line, what would you expect the price to be for a 5 carat diamond?    Compute the coefficient of correlation. What does it tell you about the relationship between the size of a diamond and the price?       We're going to use the same file we used in the previous problem:   Now we will take into consideration the other characteristics of diamonds that determine price: carat, color, clarity, and cut. Let's redo the regression and create a model that does a better job than the one in the previous example that only included a single predictor variable.     Create the regression model with all 5 variables that are provided: color, depth (in percentage), clarity, table (in percentage), and carat.    Interpret each of the coefficients in the model.    Do all 5 of the predictor variables belong in the model? Why or why not?    Is the overall model valid? Why or why not?    What is the coefficient of determination? What does it tell you about the model?    Remove variables one by one and reassess the model. What is the best model to predict the price of a diamond? Why?      "

  "title": "The Normal Distribution",
  "body": " The Normal Distribution  The mathematical expression that describes the shape of the normal probability distribution is called the normal probability density function: Despite the complexity of this function, there are only two parameters that completely deter- mine the shape of the distribution: the mean, , and the standard deviation, . Let’s take a closer look at how they impact the distribution. (Don’t worry---we won’t be using this formula to compute probabilities. We have other tools!)    How does changing the standard deviation ( ) and the mean ( ) change the curve?  Graph of Normal Distribution powered by Desmos           controls the spread of the curve. Larger results in a flatter, more spread out curve     controls the location of the center. Larger shifts the hill of the curve to the right        Characteristics of the Normal Probability Distribution:     The distribution is bell-shaped and symmetric around the mean.    Because the shape is symmetrical, the mean and median are equal and located at the center of the distribution.    Random variables around the mean, where the curve is the tallest have a higher probability of occurring than values toward the end of the distribution.    The total area under the curve is . Since the distribution is symmetric, the area to the left of the mean equals as does the area to the right of the mean    No matter how far in either direction the distribution curve extends, it never touches the horizontal axis -- but it gets increasingly closer.       Examples of Normal Probability Distributions:      The Standard Normal Distribution:  Recall that the -score of a value, , describes the number of standard deviations that the value is from the mean of its distribution:    Values of that are less than the mean have _______ -scores    Values of that are more than the mean have _______ -scores    The -score for the mean equals ________      A coffee shop wants to understand the distribution of amounts that their customers are spending per order. They find that the average amount a customer spends per order is , and the standard deviation is . If we assume that the amounts spent per order are normally distributed, and Rey comes in and spends , what is the -score for Rey's order?         When the original random variable, , follows a normal distribution, -scores also follow a normal distribution with , . It is called the standard normal distribution .     Graph of Standard Normal Distribution powered by Desmos    The standard normal distribution allows us to calculate probabilities for any normal distribution since we can standardize it with -scores. The tables at this link ( Standard Normal Table ) provide you with the cumulative area to the LEFT of the -score.  We can also use Excel to calculate the cumulative area to the left of the -score by typing   ( Note: We can type 1 instead of TRUE in this formula in Excel.)     Find the probability for a standard normal distribution    In Excel:      So how do we use the table or the Excel formula to find any probability for a normal distribution?  There are 3 basic types of problems:   To the left of any -score: Look up the -score in the table (or calculate it in Excel) and use the area given.    To the right of any -score: Look up the -score in the table (or calculate it in Excel) subtract the area from 1.    Between any two -scores: Look up both -scores in the table (or calculate them in Excel) and subtract the smaller area from the larger area.
