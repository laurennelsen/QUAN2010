A negative value indicates that as increases, decreases.     Recall that we used the Excel formula, CORREL, to calculate this number in a previous chapter.

  "body": " Developing a Regression Model  Now we are going to learn techniques to create models that fit our data. Regression analysis is the modeling procedure that we will study. We will discuss how to perform the calculations in the formulas involved in creating and assessing regression models. However, in most cases we will rely on the Regression tool in the Data Analysis tab of Excel.   Regression Example powered by Desmos     Regression Line with Error powered by Desmos      Regression analysis enables us to describe a straight line that best fits the data.   In simple regression analysis, there is one independent variable.    In multiple regression analysis, there is more than one independent variable.     The formula for the linear regression model created with sample data is where   The are called regression coefficients . The simple regression model is often just called the regression line .     (Donnelly 14.56)  As a measure of productivity, Verizon Wireless records the number of customers each of its retail employees activates weekly. An activation is defined as either a new customer signing a cell phone contract or an existing customer renewing a contract. The data table found in this lesson's Excel file shows the number of weekly activations for eight randomly selected employees along with their job-satisfaction levels rated on a scale of ( Most satisfied).    Construct a scatter plot for these data. Let satisfaction be the independent variable and let activations be the dependent variable.   Determine the equation of the regression line for the data.   Interpret the value of the slope in the equation.   Predict the number of activations for an employee with a satisfaction level of 7.4.   Calculate the correlation coefficient for this sample.   Using , test to determine if the population correlation coefficient is not equal to zero. What conclusions can be made based on these results?    (Donnelly 15.6)  A hospital would like to develop a regression model to predict the total hospital bill for a patient based on the age of the patient ( ), the patient's length of stay ( ), and the number of days in the hospital's intensive care unit (ICU) ( ). Data for these variables can be found in the table in the Excel file below.    Construct a regression model using all three independent variables.   Interpret the meaning of the regression coefficients.   Predict the average hospital bill for a 76-year-old person hospitalized for 5 days with 3 days spent in the ICU.     The regression line will not pass through each of the data points. Hence, there is error between the true value of from the data and the value, , predicted by the regression line. This difference is called the residual , .     Regression Line with Error powered by Desmos     Let's look at the regression model below and think about the actual versus the predicted -values.   Regression Line Error powered by Desmos     For , what is the corresponding -value, and what is ?   For , what is ?     The mathematical procedure that is used to find the regression line is the least squares method . The least squares method aims to minimize the total squared error between the values of and . This sum is also called the sum of squares error (SSE) , and is definted by the formula Minimizing the SSE results in the best fitting line through the data points.    Scatter Plot (Made in GeoGebra by Ivan Gatewood)       There are two other sum of squares related to our data points:   the total sum of squares (SST):     the sum of squares regression (SSR):    (where the average value of the dependent variable from the sample)     All of the sum of squares are related:    The total sum of squares (SST) , measures the total variation in the dependent variable.    The sum of squares regression (SSR) , measures the amount of variation in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variable(s).    The ratio of these two numbers, , is called the coefficient of determination . It measures the percentage of the total variation of the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variable(s) in the model.       Let's go back to the Verizon example from earlier.  As a measure of productivity, Verizon Wireless records the number of customers each of its retail employees activates weekly. An activation is defined as either a new customer signing a cell phone contract or an existing customer renewing a contract. The data table found in this lesson's Excel file shows the number of weekly activations for eight randomly selected employees along with their job-satisfaction levels rated on a scale of ( Most satisfied).    Identify the SST. (Hint: Use the Regression output from Excel.)   Partition the SST into the SSE and the SSR.   Calculate the coefficient of determination, .

  "body": " Using Regression to Make a Prediction  We can use our regression model to make predictions based on given values of the independent variables -- just plug the given values into the respective independent variable of the regression model. But how reliable is this prediction? We only have sample data so the prediction isn't perfect. Similar to what we did in a previous chapter, we will construct a confidence interval to aid in describing the accuracy of our predictions.  There are a number of confidence intervals that we can create based on our regression model that provide insight into the validity of the model. The only one we will focus on is related to the population slopes: It turns out we will likely not need this formula, however, since the Regression tool in Excel will do most of the work for us.   Let's look back at the hospital example from earlier.  A hospital would like to develop a regression model to predict the total hospital bill for a patient based on the age of the patient ( ), the patient's length of stay ( ), and the number of days in the hospital's intensive care unit (ICU) ( ). Data for these variables can be found in the table in the Excel file below.   Construct and interpret the confidence interval for the regression coefficient for each of the independent variables in the model.   "

  "body": " Diamonds Modeling  (Background on diamonds was provided in part by research done at https:\/\/www.brilliance.com\/education\/diamonds\/depth-table)  When a gemologist determines the value of a diamond, he or she considers a number of different factors. These factors are known as the 4C's (carat, color, clarity, and cut). How large is the diamond? The size (really the weight) of the diamond is measured in carats. Is it colorless or does it have a slight hue of color? Are there any visible inclusions in the diamond (this affects the clarity)?  Was the stone cut well? This is described by both the table and the depth. They both helps to define the physical shape of a diamond and contribute to its sparkle. When these two features are proportioned just right, a diamond of any size looks spectacular.  Every diamond has a flat, square-shaped facet on its top called the table. It plays a critical role in a diamond’s appearance. The table refracts rays of light as they pass, directing them to the facets that make the diamond look so sparkly. The physical size of the table facet naturally varies depending on the overall size of the diamond. Jewelers measure the table percentage when grading a diamond’s cut. Table percentage is calculated by dividing the width of the table by the overall width of the diamond. The ideal table percentage will vary based on the shape of the diamond.  The depth of a diamond might also be called the “height”: it is the distance from the table to the culet (the pointed tip) of the diamond. Like with a diamond’s table, jewelers grade a diamond’s depth based on its depth percentage. Depth percentage is the diamond’s depth divided by the width of the diamond. This percentage dictates the overall proportions of the diamond, which in turn directly impact how light reflects off the facets in the stone.   Here is the file we are going to use for this problem:   The price of diamonds is not just determined by size, but by multiple characteristics. For simplicity, in this example we will start with size. Create the scatterplot for the two variables Price and Carat .     Determine the least squares line. Interpret the slope coefficient.    According to your least squares line, what would you expect the price to be for a 5 carat diamond?    Compute the coefficient of correlation. What does it tell you about the relationship between the size of a diamond and the price?       We're going to use the same file we used in the previous problem:   Now we will take into consideration the other characteristics of diamonds that determine price: carat, color, clarity, and cut. Let's redo the regression and create a model that does a better job than the one in the previous example that only included a single predictor variable.     Create the regression model with all 5 variables that are provided: color, depth (in percentage), clarity, table (in percentage), and carat.    Interpret each of the coefficients in the model.    Do all 5 of the predictor variables belong in the model? Why or why not?    Is the overall model valid? Why or why not?    What is the coefficient of determination? What does it tell you about the model?    Remove variables one by one and reassess the model. What is the best model to predict the price of a diamond? Why?      "

  "title": "The Normal Distribution",
  "body": " The Normal Distribution   The mathematical expression that describes the shape of the normal probability distribution is called the normal probability density function: Despite the complexity of this function, there are only two parameters that completely deter- mine the shape of the distribution: the mean, , and the standard deviation, . Let’s take a closer look at how they impact the distribution. (Don’t worry---we won’t be using this formula to compute probabilities. We have other tools!)     How does changing the standard deviation ( ) and the mean ( ) change the curve?  Graph of Normal Distribution powered by Desmos           controls the spread of the curve. Larger results in a flatter, more spread out curve     controls the location of the center. Larger shifts the hill of the curve to the right        Characteristics of the Normal Probability Distribution:     The distribution is bell-shaped and symmetric around the mean.    Because the shape is symmetrical, the mean and median are equal and located at the center of the distribution.    Random variables around the mean, where the curve is the tallest have a higher probability of occurring than values toward the end of the distribution.    The total area under the curve is . Since the distribution is symmetric, the area to the left of the mean equals as does the area to the right of the mean    No matter how far in either direction the distribution curve extends, it never touches the horizontal axis -- but it gets increasingly closer.       Examples of Normal Probability Distributions:      The Standard Normal Distribution:  Recall that the -score of a value, , describes the number of standard deviations that the value is from the mean of its distribution:    Values of that are less than the mean have _______ -scores     postive      negative      zero      Values of that are more than the mean have _______ -scores     positive      negative      zero      The -score for the mean equals ________                                A coffee shop wants to understand the distribution of amounts that their customers are spending per order. They find that the average amount a customer spends per order is , and the standard deviation is . If we assume that the amounts spent per order are normally distributed, and Rey comes in and spends , what is the -score for Rey's order?        When the original random variable, , follows a normal distribution, -scores also follow a normal distribution with , . It is called the standard normal distribution .     Graph of Standard Normal Distribution powered by Desmos      Calculating Probabilities for Normal Distributions:  The standard normal distribution allows us to calculate probabilities for any normal distribution since we can standardize it with -scores. The tables at this link ( Standard Normal Table ) provide you with the cumulative area to the LEFT of the -score.  We can also use Excel to calculate the cumulative area to the left of the -score by typing   ( Note: We can type 1 instead of TRUE in this formula in Excel.)     Find the probability for a standard normal distribution    In Excel:      So how do we use the table or the Excel formula to find any probability for a normal distribution?  There are 3 basic types of problems:   To the left of any -score: Look up the -score in the table (or calculate it in Excel) and use the area given.    To the right of any -score: Look up the -score in the table (or calculate it in Excel) subtract the area from 1.    Between any two -scores: Look up both -scores in the table (or calculate them in Excel) and subtract the smaller area from the larger area.       Find the following probabilities for a standard normal distribution:       In Excel:         In Excel:         In Excel:       Normal Distribution Probability Calculator (Made in GeoGebra by Andreas Lindner)     We already saw an Excel command that will allow us to find a probability associated with a standard normal distribution. There is also an Excel command that allows us to find a probability associated with a general normal distribution, and in this case, we will need to specify the mean and standard deviation of the distribution. (These first two commands both apply to situations where the goal is to compute a probability associated with a data value.)    : applies to problems involving a normal distribution with a specified mean and standard deviation     : applies to problems involving the standard normal distribution ( )   (As we've seen before, cumulative .)

Computing Probabilities for the Exponential Distributions  There is no table for helping us calculate probabilities associated with an exponential distribution. So we will rely on a formula and Excel to help with these calculations. The formula for calculating the probability that a random variable is less than a specified value is: where .  The Excel formula for calculating probabilities for the exponential distribution is where cumulative=TRUE (if you want cumulative probability) or FALSE (if you do not want cumulative probability).  (Donnelly 6.21,22)  An exponential probability distribution has a mean equal to 5 minutes per customer. Calculate the following probabilities for the distribution.       OR                      Exponential Probability Practice  An exponential probability distribution has lambda equal to customers per hour. Find the probability that the next customer will arrive within the next minute. (Round your answer to 4 decimal places.)     0.2592   Good!      "

It is not a coincidence that we are using in both of these distributions. A discrete random variable that follows a Poisson distribution with a mean equal to has a counterpart continuous random variable that follows the exponential distribution with a mean equal to .  It is easy to confuse the two -- try to remember that is a countable (discrete) rate while is a measurable (continuous) interval.  A small bit of good news: the standard deviation for an exponential distribution is equal to its mean. That is, .  "
