  "title": "Introduction to Probability",
  "body": " Introduction to Probability   Decision makers, including those in the business world, are greatly influenced by uncertainty. Probability provides a valuable tool in quantifying uncertainty, leading to greater success in decision-making.     A probability is a numerical value between 0 and 1 that measures the chance, or likelihood, that a specific event will occur.    Before jumping into some examples, let's discuss some key terms for our study of probability concepts.       An experiment results in a specific outcome e.g., a coin flip (the experiment) results in a heads or a tails (the outcome).    An event is a collection of outcome(s) of an experiment, e.g., a die roll results in an odd number . More specifically, a simple event is an event with a single outcome.    The sample space for an experiment consists of all possible outcomes e.g., .    The outcomes must be collectively exhaustive and mutually exclusive .     Collectively exhaustive means every simple event is included     Mutually exclusive means events that cannot occur at the same time.            A single die is rolled.   Define the sample space.       Define the event an odd number is rolled . What is the probability of this event?        A pair of dice are rolled.   Define the sample space. (How many total possible outcomes are there?)    There are 36 total possible outcomes.   Define the event doubles are rolled . What is the probability of this event?        Define the event the sum of the dice is 10 . What is the probability of this event?         (Donnelly 4.8)  The table below shows the frequencies of executives' salary ranges at a particular organization.    Salary Range  Frequency    Under $60,000  2    $60,000 to under $70,000  5    $70,000 to under $80,000  7    $80,000 to under $90,000  4    $90,000 to under $100,000  6    $100,000 or more  ?    Total:  26       How many executives at this organization earned $100,000 or more per year?       What is the probability of randomly selecting an executive who earned $100,000 or more per year?       What is the probability of randomly selecting an executive who earned $60,000 or more per year?       What is the probability of randomly selecting an executive who earned between $70,000 and $90,000 per year?            Basic Properties of Probability:   If , then event is certain to occur.    If , then event is certain to NOT occur.    The probability of any event must range between 0 and 1 (inclusive).    The sum of all probabilities of simple events in a sample space is equal to 1.        The complement , (or ), is defined as all outcomes in the sample space that are not in .      The complement rule:      Draw one card from a standard deck of 52 playing cards. (Here is a link to a description of a deck of cards: )   How many total outcomes are in the sample space for this experiment?       What is the probability of drawing a face card ?       What is the probability of drawing a card divisible by 3 ?       What is the probability of drawing a card NOT divisible by 3 ?       What is the probability of drawing a card that is a face card and a card divisible by 3 ?   0   What is the probability of drawing a card that is a red card or a black card ?   1        A contingency table shows the number of occurrences of events that are classified by two categorical variables.     Marginal probability is a simple probability found in the margins, or row and column totals, of a contingency table.        (Donnelly 4.19)  A local car dealership currently has 36 used GM, Ford, and Toyota vehicles on the lot that can be classified as either cars or trucks. The following data are available:   Twenty-six vehicles are cars    Eleven vehicles are GMs    Fifteen vehicles are Fords    Three vehicles are both Toyotas and trucks    Fourteen vehicles are both Toyotas and trucks      ....(Figure out how to make fillable table......) Create a contingency table that summarizes the data.   What is the probability that a randomly selected vehicle is a Toyota?       What is the probability that a randomly selected vehicle is a truck?         The intersection of Events A and B represents the number of times when events A and B occur at the same time   Notation:     The union of Events A and B represents the number of times when event A or event B or both occur.   Notation:         Union and Intersection (Made in GeoGebra by Vaibhav Zade)       The joint probability of two events is the probability of the intersection of two events.     The addition rule for probabilities is used to calculate the probability of the union of events. It depends on knowing whether or not two events are mutually exclusive.     For mutually exclusive events,     For events that are not mutually exclusive,        Use the contingency table from the previous exercise... (insert!!!!!) to answer the following questions.   What is the probability that a randomly selected vehicle is either a Ford or a car?       What is the probability that a randomly selected vehicle is a GM truck?              Conditional probability is the probability that event A will occur given that event B has occurred.  This probability is denoted by , and is the probability of A given B .     (Made in GeoGebra by Virginia Keith)     Which of the following is the formula used to calculate ?                                 Let's look back at the contingency table from previous exercises..... (!!!insert!!!!)   What is the probability that a randomly selected vehicle is a Toyota, given it is a car?

(i.e., how do groups of data compare to the overall data?) This leads to arguably the most important topic in all of statistics.    We're going to do an activity where we roll dice and think about the distributions of the averages of our rolls.  Use the Excel file below to record your rolls for this activity.   (If you don't have dice, you can use the tool below.)   (Made in GeoGebra by Duane Habecker)      Roll a die at least 20 times. Use the Excel file above to record what you get on each roll. Then use the Data Analysis Histogram tool to visualize the distribution of rolls with the Bins  . (Before visualizing the rolls, think about what you expect the distribution to look like.)    Now roll 2 dice and in the next sheet of the Excel file, record those two rolls and then find the average of those two rolls. Repeat this at least 20 times. Use Excel to create a histogram of the averages .    Now roll 3 dice and in the next sheet of the Excel file, record those three rolls and then find the average of those three rolls. Repeat this at least 20 times. Use Excel to create a histogram of the averages .    Next we want to do this for averages of a larger number of rolls.

A sampling distribution of the mean is a distribution of the mean from numerous samples of the sample size. This distribution has mean and a standard error (i.e. the standard deviation of the sample means) .    There are three important properties that describe the distribution of sample means:   The sampling distribution of the mean of a random variable drawn from any population is approximately normal for sufficiently large sample size. The larger the sample size, the more closely the sample distribution resembles a normal distribution.    The mean of the sample means will be the same as the population mean; that is, .    The standard deviation of the sample means will be smaller than the standard deviation of the population; specifically,       (Donnelly 7.7)  For a population with a mean equal to 250 and a standard deviation equal to 25, calculate the standard error of the mean for the following sample sizes.   20       50       80        What can you conclude about the standard error as the sample size increases?     As the sample size increases, standard error decreases      As the sample size increases, standard error increases.      As the sample size increases, standard error stays the same.      As the sample size increases, the standard error might increase, decrease, or stay the same.     "

There are basically three scenarios that come up that involve the use of the Central Limit Theorem:   If the samples are drawn from a normal population, then the sampling distribution of the sample means will also be normally distributed regardless of the size of the samples.    The sampling distribution of the sample means will not be normally distributed when samples of size are drawn from a population that is not necessarily normal.    If samples of size are drawn from a population that is not necessarily normal, then the Central Limit Theorem does not apply and we cannot draw conclusions about the sampling distribution of the sample means.      Bottom line: If the sample size is large enough, then we can use the Central Limit Theorem to answer the questions about sample means using the same techniques that we used to answer questions about individual values of a normally distributed population. All we need to do is adjust the -score calculation to account for the new standard deviation.

  "body": " Diamonds Modeling  (Background on diamonds was provided in part by research done at https:\/\/www.brilliance.com\/education\/diamonds\/depth-table)  When a gemologist determines the value of a diamond, he or she considers a number of different factors. These factors are known as the 4C's (carat, color, clarity, and cut). How large is the diamond? The size (really the weight) of the diamond is measured in carats. Is it colorless or does it have a slight hue of color? Are there any visible inclusions in the diamond (this affects the clarity)?  Was the stone cut well? This is described by both the table and the depth. They both helps to define the physical shape of a diamond and contribute to its sparkle. When these two features are proportioned just right, a diamond of any size looks spectacular.  Every diamond has a flat, square-shaped facet on its top called the table. It plays a critical role in a diamond’s appearance. The table refracts rays of light as they pass, directing them to the facets that make the diamond look so sparkly. The physical size of the table facet naturally varies depending on the overall size of the diamond. Jewelers measure the table percentage when grading a diamond’s cut. Table percentage is calculated by dividing the width of the table by the overall width of the diamond. The ideal table percentage will vary based on the shape of the diamond.  The depth of a diamond might also be called the “height”: it is the distance from the table to the culet (the pointed tip) of the diamond. Like with a diamond’s table, jewelers grade a diamond’s depth based on its depth percentage. Depth percentage is the diamond’s depth divided by the width of the diamond. This percentage dictates the overall proportions of the diamond, which in turn directly impact how light reflects off the facets in the stone.   Here is the file we are going to use for this problem:   The price of diamonds is not just determined by size, but by multiple characteristics. For simplicity, in this example we will start with size. Create the scatterplot for the two variables Price and Carat .     Determine the least squares line. Interpret the slope coefficient.    According to your least squares line, what would you expect the price to be for a 5 carat diamond?    Compute the coefficient of correlation. What does it tell you about the relationship between the size of a diamond and the price?       We're going to use the same file we used in the previous problem:   Now we will take into consideration the other characteristics of diamonds that determine price: carat, color, clarity, and cut. Let's redo the regression and create a model that does a better job than the one in the previous example that only included a single predictor variable.     Create the regression model with all 5 variables that are provided: color, depth (in percentage), clarity, table (in percentage), and carat.    Interpret each of the coefficients in the model.    Do all 5 of the predictor variables belong in the model? Why or why not?    Is the overall model valid? Why or why not?    What is the coefficient of determination?

  "title": "The Normal Distribution",
  "body": " The Normal Distribution   The mathematical expression that describes the shape of the normal probability distribution is called the normal probability density function: Despite the complexity of this function, there are only two parameters that completely deter- mine the shape of the distribution: the mean, , and the standard deviation, . Let’s take a closer look at how they impact the distribution. (Don’t worry---we won’t be using this formula to compute probabilities. We have other tools!)     How does changing the standard deviation ( ) and the mean ( ) change the curve?  Graph of Normal Distribution powered by Desmos           controls the spread of the curve. Larger results in a flatter, more spread out curve     controls the location of the center. Larger shifts the hill of the curve to the right        Characteristics of the Normal Probability Distribution:     The distribution is bell-shaped and symmetric around the mean.    Because the shape is symmetrical, the mean and median are equal and located at the center of the distribution.    Random variables around the mean, where the curve is the tallest have a higher probability of occurring than values toward the end of the distribution.    The total area under the curve is . Since the distribution is symmetric, the area to the left of the mean equals as does the area to the right of the mean    No matter how far in either direction the distribution curve extends, it never touches the horizontal axis -- but it gets increasingly closer.       Examples of Normal Probability Distributions:      The Standard Normal Distribution:  Recall that the -score of a value, , describes the number of standard deviations that the value is from the mean of its distribution:    Values of that are less than the mean have _______ -scores     postive      negative      zero      Values of that are more than the mean have _______ -scores     positive      negative      zero      The -score for the mean equals ________                                A coffee shop wants to understand the distribution of amounts that their customers are spending per order. They find that the average amount a customer spends per order is , and the standard deviation is . If we assume that the amounts spent per order are normally distributed, and Rey comes in and spends , what is the -score for Rey's order?        When the original random variable, , follows a normal distribution, -scores also follow a normal distribution with , . It is called the standard normal distribution .     Graph of Standard Normal Distribution powered by Desmos      Calculating Probabilities for Normal Distributions:  The standard normal distribution allows us to calculate probabilities for any normal distribution since we can standardize it with -scores. The tables at this link ( Standard Normal Table ) provide you with the cumulative area to the LEFT of the -score.  We can also use Excel to calculate the cumulative area to the left of the -score by typing   ( Note: We can type 1 instead of TRUE in this formula in Excel.)     Find the probability for a standard normal distribution    In Excel:      So how do we use the table or the Excel formula to find any probability for a normal distribution?  There are 3 basic types of problems:   To the left of any -score: Look up the -score in the table (or calculate it in Excel) and use the area given.    To the right of any -score: Look up the -score in the table (or calculate it in Excel) subtract the area from 1.    Between any two -scores: Look up both -scores in the table (or calculate them in Excel) and subtract the smaller area from the larger area.       Find the following probabilities for a standard normal distribution:       In Excel:         In Excel:         In Excel:       Normal Distribution Probability Calculator (Made in GeoGebra by Andreas Lindner)     We already saw an Excel command that will allow us to find a probability associated with a standard normal distribution. There is also an Excel command that allows us to find a probability associated with a general normal distribution, and in this case, we will need to specify the mean and standard deviation of the distribution. (These first two commands both apply to situations where the goal is to compute a probability associated with a data value.)    : applies to problems involving a normal distribution with a specified mean and standard deviation     : applies to problems involving the standard normal distribution ( )   (As we've seen before, cumulative .)

Find the following:   Find the probability that a randomly selected 5 year old girl's height is is at least cm.    .   Find the probability that a randomly selected 5 year old girl's height is between and cm.    .

Let's look at how it impacts the shape of the distribution.  Exponential Distribution powered by Desmos      Differences between the Exponential and Normal Distributions     The shape of the exponential distribution is right-skewed while the shape of the normal distribution is bell-shaped and symmetric.    The shape of the exponential distribution is controlled by only one parameter, , while the shape of the normal distribution requires two parameters, and .    The values of an exponential distribution are always positive; they can never be negative. Values of the normal distribution can be both positive and negative.       Computing Probabilities for the Exponential Distributions  There is no table for helping us calculate probabilities associated with an exponential distribution. So we will rely on a formula and Excel to help with these calculations. The formula for calculating the probability that a random variable is less than a specified value is: where .  The Excel formula for calculating probabilities for the exponential distribution is where cumulative=TRUE (if you want cumulative probability) or FALSE (if you do not want cumulative probability).
