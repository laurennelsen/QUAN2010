  <title>The Sampling Distribution of the Proportion</title>


  <p>
    So far, the focus in this chapter has been on the distribution of sample means.  However, sometimes we deal with business scenarios where we are counting observations in a sample and in this case the sample proportion (or percentage), <m>\overline{p}</m>, is the statistic that is relevant rather than the sample mean, <m>\overline{x}</m>.

      <p>
        The <em>sampling distribution of the proportion</em> describes the pattern that the sample proportions tend to follow when randomly drawn from a population.  This distribution has a mean, <m>\overline{p}=\frac{x}{n}</m>, and a standard error (i.e. the standard deviation of the sample proportions), <m>\sigma_p=\sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}</m>.

      <p>
        A social media survey found that <m>69\%</m> of parents <q>follow</q> their children on Instagram.  A random sample of 140 parents was selected.

          What is the probability that 104 or more parents from this sample <q>follow</q> their children on Instagram?

        <p>
          <me>P\left(\overline{p}\geq \frac{104}{140}\right) = 1-P\left(\overline{p}\lt \frac{104}{140}\right)\approx 0.0869</me>

      <statement>
        <p>
          What is the probability that between 97 and 104 parents from this sample <q>follow</q> their children on Instagram?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <answer>
        <p>
          <me>P\left(\frac{97}{140}\lt \overline{p}\lt \frac{104}{140}\right) \approx 0.3812</me>

    <task>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If 81 parents responded that the <q>follow</q> their children on Instagram, does this result support the findings of the social media survey?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <answer>
        <p>
          <me>P\left(\overline{p}\leq \frac{81}{140}\right) \approx 0.0023</me>
          Since <m>0.0023\lt 0.05 </m> (less than <m>5\%</m>), the sample with only 81 parents answering <q>yes</q> is unusual.  Therefore, the survey results are questionable.
