        A <em>binomial experiment</em> is a probability experiment possessing the following characteristics:
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              It has a fixed number of trials, <m>n</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
             Each trial has only two possible outcomes:  success or failure.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The probability of success, <m>p</m>, and the probability of failure, <m>q</m>, are constant.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Each trial is independent of the other trials.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>

      <p>
        The outcomes of a binomial experiment and the corresponding probabilities of these outcomes are called a <em>binomial distribution</em>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The probability of exactly <m>X</m> successes in <m>n</m> trials with probability of success, <m>p</m>, is
      </p>
      <me>P(X)=\frac{n!}{X!(n-X)!}p^X(1-p)^{n-X}\text{ for }X=0,1,2,...,n
      </me>
