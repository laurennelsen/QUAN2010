        Correlation analysis provides a way to measure the strength and direction of the linear relationship between the two variables (the aforementioned independent and dependent variables).  This is done by computing the <em>sample correlation coefficient</em>, <m>r</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
        The range of the correlation coefficient is <m>-1\text{ to } 1</m>.

        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    A <em>positive</em> value indicates that as <m>x</m> increases, <m>y</m> also increases.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    A <em>negative</em> value indicates that as <m>x</m> increases, <m>y</m> decreases.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    Recall that we used the Excel formula, CORREL, to calculate this number in a previous chapter.  Now we improve on that skill by learning how to use a hypothesis test to assess the strength of the linear relationship described by <m>r</m>.
</p>

<p>
    The population correlation coefficient, <m>\rho</m>, refers to the correlation between all values of two variables in a population.  A value of <m>\rho=0</m> means that there is no linear relationship between <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>.  We don't know the value of <m>\rho</m> so we use the sample correlation coefficient to test whether we have enough evidence from the sample to conclude that there is a linear relationship between the variables in the population.  The two hypotheses for this hypothesis test are:

        The test statistic uses the Student's <m>t</m>-distribution with formula:
    </p>

    <p>
        <me>
            t = \frac{r}{\sqrt{\frac{1-r^2}{n-2}}}
         </me>
    </p>
