  <title>Confidence Intervals for Proportions</title>

  <introduction>

<p>
    We can also estimate the proportion of a population by constructing a confidence interval from a sample.  Recall that proportion data follow the binomial distribution, which can be approximated by the normal distribution under the conditions:
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                <m>np\geq 5</m> and
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <m>n(1-p)\geq 5</m>,
            </p>
        </li>
        where <m>p=</m> the probability of success and <m>n=</m> the sample size.
    </ul>
</p>

    <statement>
        <p>
            The <em>confidence interval for the proportion</em> is an interval estimate around a sample proportion that provides a range of where <m>p</m> lies.
        </p>

        <p>
            The formula for this confidence interval is
            <me>\overline{p}\pm z_{\alpha/2}\cdot\hat{\sigma}_p,</me>
            where <m>\overline{p}=\frac{x}{n}</m> and <m>\hat{\sigma}_p=\sqrt{\frac{\overline{p}(1-\overline{p})}{n}}</m>.  
        </p>

        <p>
            The sample proportion, <m>\overline{p}</m>, measures the fraction of <q>successes</q> in the sample.

        <p>
            The IRS reported that <m>85\%</m> of individual tax returns were filed electronically in 2017.  A random sample of 240 tax returns from 2018 was selected.  From this sample, 187 were filed electronically.

                What is the point estimate based on this sample?

        <answer>
            <p>
                <me>\overline{p}=\frac{187}{240}\approx 0.779</me>

            <p>
                Construct a <m>90\%</m> confidence interval to estimate the actual proportion of taxpayers who filed electronically in 2018?
            </p>
        </statement>
        <answer>
            <p>
                We are <m>90\%</m> confident that <m>0.7349\lt p \lt 0.8231</m>.  (That is, we are <m>90\%</m> confident that the proportion of taxpayers who filed electronically in 2018 is between <m>73.49\%</m> and <m>82.31\%</m>.)

            <p>
                Is there any evidence that this proportion has changed since 2017 based on this sample?
            </p>
        </statement>
        <answer>
            <p>
                Since 0.85 does not fall in the interval, there is evidence that the proportion of electronic filers has changed.
